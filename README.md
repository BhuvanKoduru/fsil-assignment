# General Timeline

This readme provides an overview of the project's timeline, detailing various tasks, tools, and methodologies used during its development.

## Tasks and Tools Overview

1. **Understanding 10-K Filings:**
   - Watched a YouTube video to grasp the concept of 10-K filings.
   - Learned about their contents and how to skim through them efficiently.

2. **Exploring SEC-EDGAR:**
   - Explored the Securities and Exchange Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (SEC-EDGAR).
   - Learned about company tickers as stock symbols.

3. **Downloading and Formatting Filings:**
   - Used the `sec_edgar_downloader` library to download 10-K filings.
   - Developed scripts to add HTML tags for proper formatting.
   - Utilized parameters for human-readable formats like HTML.

4. **Organizing and Renaming Files:**
   - Developed a Python script to organize and rename folders and corresponding HTML files based on their year.

5. **Introduction to RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):**
   - Explored the concept of using RAG for extracting insights from unseen documents.
   - Planned to create a chatbot-like application interface.

6. **Experimenting with Models:**
   - Explored various models including OpenAI, HuggingFace, Local models using ollama, and Anthropic AI.
   - Evaluated models like Intel/dynamictinybert, deepset/roberta-base-squad2, claude-3-opus, etc.

7. **Front-end Development with Streamlit:**
   - Chose Streamlit for its integration with Python and multi-page application support.
   - Learned about session state and variables to maintain data across pages.

## Task 1: Data Processing and Preparing Insights

### Task 1.1: Data Retrieval and Preprocessing
- Selected companies: Apple, Microsoft, Visa, Nvidia.
- Retrieved 10-K filings using tickers and downloaded HTML files.
- Used the `download_details` argument for obtaining HTML files.
- Combined relevant HTML files into folders and loaded them using langchain's document loader.
- Split data into chunks and created a FAISS database for similarity search based on user queries.

### Task 1.2: Generating Insights from 10-K Filings
- 10-K filings are complex and lengthy, requiring insights extraction.
- Planned to use LLMs to quickly generate insights such as sales trends, risk factors, and product sales breakdown.

## Task 2: Application Construction and Deployment

- Created a homepage for selecting company tickers and timeframes.
- Implemented separate pages for different LLMs, enabling users to chat with them.
- Introduced multi-modality with LlaVa for analyzing uploaded images.
- Deployed visualizations generated by Claude's answers using QuickChart.
